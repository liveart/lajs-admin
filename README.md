LiveArt HTML5 Admin (for version 0.9.5)
==========

Current status: in development!

LiveArt HTML5 Product Designer admin area is a Laravel4 based application that facilitates administrating static configuration JSON files. Operators may import original JSON files into it, edit using CRUD panels and be able to publish endpoints that will be generating JSON back.

At present moment, the following resources are planned to be administrated:
1. Products: locations, colorizable elements and colors;
2. Graphic gallery: with colorizable elements;
3. Colors;
4. Fonts;

Separate import page would allow to import any of the above resources into DB;
Default DB used is SQLite, but one can change to anything they'd prefer;
